# Material Madness

A little theme utilizing the material-darker color palette.  
Made for [Powercord](https://powercord.dev).

## Disclaimer

This is a mess. I only made this for me to use myself. Please. Spare yourself and don't.

## Features

- material-darker color palette
- rounded text bar
- some other tiny snippets
- some other not so tiny snippets
- yeah that's basically it

## Recommended Themes Alongside This One

- [GradientButtons v2](https://github.com/Discord-Theme-Addons/gradientbuttons-v2)
- [Discord-TeardropMessages (already included)](https://github.com/Freeplayg/Discord-TeardropMessages)

## How to Install

### Powercord

- Enter your powercord themes folder.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/iblowmymind/material-madness`
- Voila!

### Basically anything else (untested)

- Try to see if there's a way to inject Custom CSS.
- If there is, try: `@import url("https://iblowmymind.github.io/material-madness/src/main.css");` on any subdomain or URL under https://discord.com/app (or canary.discord.com or... you get the idea)
- This is not guaranteed to work, but voila! I think?
- **Testing would be welcome, if you tried this and if it works (or not), feel free to create an issue!**
