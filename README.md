# Material Madness

![Theme Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.5.7.0-blue)
  
A little theme utilizing the material-darker color palette.  
Made for [Replugged](https://replugged.dev).


## Disclaimer

This is a mess. I only made this for me to use myself. Please spare yourself and don't use it. If I can't persuade you, though, check below for install instructions.

## Features

- [Material Darker](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-material-theme) color palette
- Rounded text bar, "unread messages" etc.
- A bunch of [snippets](https://iblowmymind.github.io/material-madness/src/snippets.css), some tiny, others not so tiny (credits included!)
- Fixes, hides & components

## Recommended Themes Alongside This One

- ~~[GradientButtons](https://github.com/discord-extensions/snippets/tree/main/gradient-buttons)~~ (already included in the theme in imports.css)
- ~~[Discord-TeardropMessages](https://github.com/Freeplayg/Discord-TeardropMessages)~~ (already included is a patched version in snippets.css)
- [Modern Indicators](https://github.com/discord-extensions/modern-indicators)

## How to Install

### Replugged (and Topaz)

#### Replugged URL Install

- Click [this link](https://replugged.dev/install?url=iblowmymind/material-madness) to let Replugged automagically install the theme for you.
- Enable the theme from Settings.

#### Git Clone

- Enter your Replugged themes folder.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/iblowmymind/material-madness`
- Enable the theme from Settings.

### Stylus (Untested)

- Install a Userstyle plugin like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html). (do NOT use Stylish, it's spyware)
- Click [this link](https://github.com/iblowmymind/material-madness/raw/main/material-madness.user.css) and click "Install style".
- **I'm not sure if this works right now, so testing would be welcome, if you tried this and if it works (or not), feel free to create an issue!**

### Basically anything else (Untested)

- Try to see if there's a way to inject Custom CSS.
- If there is, try: `@import url("https://iblowmymind.github.io/material-madness/src/main.css");` on any subdomain or URL under https://discord.com/app (or canary.discord.com or... you get the idea)
- This is not guaranteed to work, but voila! I think?
- **Testing would be welcome, if you tried this and if it works (or not), feel free to create an issue!**
